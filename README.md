All documentation for the project is under the DOCUMENTATION folder and instructions on how to run and use the app are on the [wiki](https://github.com/amansahil/Group_24_SDI_SOFT20091/wiki#pages). If you would like to report an issue or contribute code to the project please read the [CONTRIBUTION.md](https://github.com/amansahil/Group_24_SDI_SOFT20091/blob/master/DOCS/CONTRIBUTION.md) file in the docs folder on how to do so.
